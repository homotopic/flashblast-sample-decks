00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,500
This {{blade}} has a {{dark}} past.

2
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,800
It {{has shed}} {{much}} {{innocent}} blood.

3
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,450
{{You're}} a fool for {{traveling}} {{alone}}, so completely {{unprepared}}.

4
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,800
You're lucky your {{blood's}} still {{flowing}}.

7
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,500
What {{brings}} you to the land of the {{gatekeepers}}?

8
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,500
I'm {{searching}} for someone.

9
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,200
{{Someone}} very dear? A kindred {{spirit}}?

11
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,750
A {{dangerous}} {{quest}} {{for}} a lone {{hunter}}.

12
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,870
I've been {{alone}} for {{as long as}} I can {{remember}}.

13
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,200
We're {{almost}} done. Shhh...

14
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,500
Hey, sit {{still}}.

15
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:52,250
{{Good night}}, Scales.

16
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,850
{{Get him}}, Scales! Come on!

20
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,500
I have {{failed}}.

21
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,500
{{You've}} {{only}} failed {{to see}}...

22
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,500
{{These}} are dragon {{lands}}, Sintel.

23
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,000
You are {{closer}} {{than}} you know.
